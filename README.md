# NodeJS Mentoring Program Repo

## Introduction to NodeJS

## Scripts

- `npm start`: starts `index.js` file using `nodeman` package.

### Notes

- `index.js` file has `getRandomNumber` function inside. However, it wasn't clear for me what does this acceptance criteria mean: `working with REPL execution getRandomNumber() function in CLI`. So, I just run REPL mode from the script. Please, let me know if it is not what expected.
