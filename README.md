# NodeJS Mentoring Program Repo

EPAM learn e-book: <https://ebook.learn.epam.com>
Available only with company sign-in.

## 1. Introduction to NodeJS

All the files related to the task are in `/1-introduction-to-nodejs` folder.

### Scripts

- `npm run start-introduction`: starts `/1-introduction-to-nodejs/index.js` file using `nodeman` package.

### Notes

- `/1-introduction-to-nodejs/index.js` file has `getRandomNumber` function inside. However, it wasn't clear for me what does this acceptance criteria mean: `working with REPL execution getRandomNumber() function in CLI`. So, I just run REPL mode from the script. Please, let me know if it is not what expected.

### Screenshots

All required screenshots are in the folder `/1-introduction-to-nodejs`

## 2. Standard Library

All the files related to the task are in `/2-standard-library` folder.

### Scripts

- `npm run start-standard-library`: starts `/2-standard-library/index.js` file using `nodeman` package.
- `npm run start-standard-library-node`: starts `/2-standard-library/index.js` file using just `NodeJS`.

### Notes

- In the `/2-standard-library` there is a folder `dev` it has files I used for learning. All the task related code is in the `/2-standard-library/index.js` file and `/2-standard-library/utils` folder.
- I tested it in `Windows` and `MacOS`. However, when run in `Windows`, the `powershell` command takes up to 3-4 seconds to execute, so I am not sure how to meet requirements to update log 10 times per second.

## 3. EventEmitter, Buffer, Streams

### Scripts

## Tasks 1, 2, 3

- `npm run start-eventemitter-buffer-streams-1`: starts `/2-eventemitter-buffer-streams/task1/index.js` file using `nodeman` package.
- `npm run start-eventemitter-buffer-streams-2`: starts `/2-eventemitter-buffer-streams/task2/index.js` file using `nodeman` package.
- `npm run start-eventemitter-buffer-streams-3`: starts `/2-eventemitter-buffer-streams/task3/index.js` file using `nodeman` package.
